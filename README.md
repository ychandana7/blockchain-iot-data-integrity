# blockchain-iot-data-integrity
Built a blockchain-based system to verify IoT file integrity using SHA-256 hashing and Ethereum smart contracts. Stored file hashes immutably on the blockchain to detect tampering. Developed with Flask, Solidity, Web3.js, MetaMask, and Ganache for secure verification.
Project Title
Blockchain-Based Data Integrity Verification for IoT Communication

Description
This project ensures the authenticity and integrity of IoT-generated data using blockchain technology. It uses SHA-256 hashing to create a unique fingerprint for each file, stored on the Ethereum blockchain using a Solidity smart contract. This allows detection of any tampering, as altered files produce different hashes.

The system is built with Flask (Python) for the backend and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend. It interacts with the blockchain using Web3.js, Ganache, and MetaMask. A user-friendly web interface enables uploading files, generating hashes, and verifying data integrity securely.

Technologies Used
Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Blockchain: Solidity, Ethereum, MetaMask, Ganache, Web3.js
